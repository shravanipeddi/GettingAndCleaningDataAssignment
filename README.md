#Getting & Cleaning Data  
##Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones  
  
The runAnalysis.R is a R-script that loads & cleans the data as per the requirements stated in the assignment problem statement.  
  
1) The script loads the activities, features and corresponding subject information.  
2) Creates a unified dataset containing all the above variables to form meaningful information.  
3) Filters only the fields of variables containing the mean and standard deviation information.  
4) Then aggregates or calculates the mean for each of the variables by subject & activity.  
  
  
The flow of the runAnalysis.R, the variables involved in calculating the required data set and the variables holding the process of getting & cleaning the data can be found in codeBook.md
